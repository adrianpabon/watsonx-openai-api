# FastAPI watsonx-Compatible Gateway

This repository hosts a **FastAPI** application that forwards requests in the OpenAI-style `/v1/chat/completions` format to **IBM watsonx.ai**. The gateway allows users to send requests using a format compatible with OpenAI but interacts with **watsonx.ai** models instead.

---

## üåê What is FastAPI?

**FastAPI** is a modern web framework designed for speed and ease of use when building APIs. It automatically generates interactive documentation using OpenAPI and is known for its high performance in production environments. In this project, FastAPI is used to create and manage the watsonx-compatible API.

## üîµ What is watsonx.ai?

**watsonx.ai** is IBM's enterprise AI platform designed for building, training, and deploying AI and machine learning models. It integrates with IBM Cloud services, allowing for efficient handling of both generative and custom AI models. This project forwards OpenAI-style API requests to interact with watsonx.ai models for text generation.

## üî¥ What is iLab (Red Hat InstructLab)?

**Red Hat InstructLab (iLab)** simplifies the development of large language models (LLMs) by offering tools for data generation and model alignment. It supports fine-tuning of models like LLaMA and IBM Granite using both human-curated and synthetic data, improving model performance without the need for expensive retraining.

---

## üü¢ What is OpenAPI?

**OpenAPI** is a standard specification that defines the structure of REST APIs in a way that can be understood by both humans and machines. In this project, OpenAPI is used through **FastAPI** to automatically generate API documentation and testing tools, such as Swagger.

[Learn more about OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/)

---

### Clarifications:
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: The API is structured similarly to OpenAI‚Äôs completion API but interacts with watsonx.ai models.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: FastAPI automatically generates Swagger documentation, accessible via `/docs`, providing interactive API testing and documentation.




## Why Use This?

This gateway provides a bridge between OpenAI‚Äôs API format and watsonx.ai, allowing you to:
- **Seamlessly integrate with watsonx.ai** without rewriting existing applications that rely on OpenAI‚Äôs API.
- **Ensure compatibility** with legacy codebases that use OpenAI‚Äôs completions endpoint.
- **Flexibility**: Leverage watsonx.ai's capabilities with minimal changes to your existing infrastructure.

## Installation

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aseelert/watsonx-openai-api
cd watsonx-openai-api
```

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, you need to set the following environment variables for both interactive mode and Docker:

- You have an IBM Cloud IAM key **`(WATSONX_IAM_APIKEY)`** for authentication.
- You have a Project ID **`(WATSONX_PROJECT_ID)`** of the watsonx.ai project.
- You have a Server Regions **`(WATSONX_REGION)`** of the watsonx.ai project. (supported: ["`us-south`", "`eu-gb`", "`jp-tok`", "`eu-de`"])
- Your watsonx.ai project has a Watson Machine Learning instance associated, which is required to manage machine learning models.
- If instructlab data generation will be use, we assume ilab is already installed.

### Required Environment Variables

- **`WATSONX_IAM_APIKEY`**: The IBM API key required to authenticate with watsonx.ai.
- **`WATSONX_PROJECT_ID`**: The Project ID for watsonx.ai, where the requests will be forwarded.
- **`WATSONX_REGION`**: The ProjectRegion for watsonx.ai ("us-south", "eu-gb", "jp-tok", "eu-de")

Start by setting the environment variables:

```bash
export WATSONX_IAM_APIKEY="your-ibm-api-key"
export WATSONX_PROJECT_ID="your-watsonx-project-id"
export WATSONX_REGION="your-watsonx-project-region"
```

Ensure these variables are properly set, or the application will fail to start.
An explanation how to set them is given in the respective sections.

## How to Run

<details>
<summary><b>Run local (Interactive mode)</b></summary>

If running interactively, use `uvicorn` to start the FastAPI application after setting the environment variables:

**install python 3.11 venv:**
```bash
sudo dnf -y install python3.11 python3.11-devel jq
python3.11 -m venv venv
source ~/watsonx-openai-api/venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

**install pip packages:**
```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir fastapi uvicorn requests streamlit tabulate llama-index-llms-ibm
```

```bash
cd fastapi-watsonx

uvicorn watsonxai-endpoint:app --reload --port 8080
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>Run as docker</b></summary>

If you prefer to run this application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

**1. Execute Docker with hub.docker.com image and IBM Variables**
This will start the application in a container, listening on port 8080, and interacting with watsonx.ai via the provided credentials.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8000 --name watsonxai-endpoint \
-e WATSONX_IAM_APIKEY=${WATSONX_IAM_APIKEY} \
-e WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=${WATSONX_PROJECT_ID} \
-e WATSONX_REGION=${WATSONX_REGION} \
aseelert/watsonxai-endpoint:1.1
```

**2. Activate live logs**

```bash
docker logs -f watsonxai-endpoint
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>Build own Docker image</b></summary>

**1. Build a local docker image**
```bash
cd fastapi-watsonx
docker build -t watsonxai-endpoint:1.1 .
```

**2. Execute Docker with local image and IBM Variables**

For Docker, pass the environment variables with the `-e` flag:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8000 --name watsonxai-endpoint \
-e WATSONX_IAM_APIKEY=${WATSONX_IAM_APIKEY} \
-e WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=${WATSONX_PROJECT_ID} \
-e WATSONX_REGION=${WATSONX_REGION} \
watsonxai-endpoint:1.1
```

**3. Activate live logs**

```bash
docker logs -f watsonxai-endpoint
```
